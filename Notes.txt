Initial Paper Prototype

Main Goal is running an organised crime family.

Soldiers? Lieutenants? --> having cards for each of them. Each with their own strengths and weaknesses

Character traits --> notoriety, Strength(experience), cunning, loyalty, etc (maybe age and family status can play part?) 

Organization reputation --> Feared, respected, etc

Main story --> Deck of cards picked in order that have certain events happening and gives the player choices on what to do.

Side story stuff --> separate deck where side events can happen  

Resources --> money, men/soldiers? (not having a card for them), guns? (commodities? Like alcohol, cars, weapons, etc)

Main mechanic is rolling dice to attempt actions (taking over bars, doing jobs), character traits make the events easier or harder.

Turns? - to simulate time (time soldiers are away on missions)
